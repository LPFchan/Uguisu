# Uguisu (BLE fob) — Ninebot G30 immobilizer

Uguisu is the **BLE key fob** module for a two-module immobilizer system:

- **Uguisu (this repo)**: short, encrypted BLE advertisements on button press
- **Guillemot (separate repo)**: scooter deck receiver that validates adverts and gates battery-to-ESC power

## Contents

- KiCad project files:
  - `Uguisu.kicad_sch`
  - `Uguisu.kicad_pcb`

## Firmware (PlatformIO)

Firmware lives in `firmware/uguisu/` and targets the Seeed XIAO nRF52840 (Bluefruit).

### Build / upload

- Install PlatformIO (VSCode/Cursor extension)
- Open `firmware/uguisu/` as a PlatformIO project
- Use **Build** / **Upload**

### Initialization

Uguisu initialises with [Whimbrel](https://github.com/LPFchan/Whimbrel), a browser-based provisioning app that injects the same AES key and counter into the fob and the receiver over Web Serial.

- **When powered over USB:** On boot, Uguisu checks for VBUS. If present, it waits up to 30 seconds for a line `PROV:DEVICE_ID:KEY_HEX:COUNTER_HEX:CHECKSUM_HEX` (e.g. `PROV:UGUISU_01:<32 hex chars>:00000000:<4 hex CRC>`). The checksum is CRC-16-CCITT of the key; if it does not match, the device replies `ERR:CHECKSUM`. On success it writes the key and device ID to internal flash, seeds the anti-replay counter log, and replies `ACK:PROV_SUCCESS`. If no valid line is received, it continues to normal operation (one-shot advertise then system off).
- **Runtime:** If `/ug_prov.bin` exists from a prior Whimbrel session, the fob uses that key and device ID; otherwise it uses a default (zeros) and the config device ID. The device ID string (e.g. `UGUISU_01`) is parsed to a 16-bit value for the BLE payload (e.g. `01` → 1).

### Protocol compatibility (Uguisu ↔ Guillemot)

The fob transmits manufacturer-specific data containing:

- `company_id(2) | payload(11)`
- `payload(11) = device_id(2) | counter(4) | command(1) | mic(4)`

The MIC is a 4-byte AES-CCM tag using:

- `nonce(13) = le16(device_id) | le32(counter) | 0x00*7`
- `msg(7) = le16(device_id) | le32(counter) | command`

## Test vectors

See `tools/test_vectors/` for a small script that generates expected MIC values for interoperability testing.

## Notes

- This repo intentionally avoids committing KiCad per-user state (`*.kicad_prl`) and backup/lock artifacts.
- Safety: do not test power-interrupt/lock behavior while riding.
